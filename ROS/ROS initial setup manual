Communication between the main user interface terminal and the subsystems utilise a local network to share data between the computers on board the Pipe Inspection Gauge. The individual systems can be accessed from the user interface terminal using the ssh command:

ssh odroid@<system_name>
	

This allows for each of the systems to be updated and for additional functionality to be added more easily without the need to completely dismantle the unit.

Initial Setup:
The user interface terminal will serve as the master in the system to set this up run the command:

ssh PIG

Then enter the password (default password= [space])
Once this is completed run the command:

roscore 

Now roscore is running and a new terminal is required 

[ctrl]+[alt]+[t]

In the new terminal run:

	ssh PIG
	export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://PIG:11311

This command sets the master connection setting for the rest of the system to connect

Open a new terminal again [ctrl]+[alt]+[T]
This is where the GUI will be started

In the new terminal run:

	rvis

This will open a new window called rvis and this is where the images will show from the PIG






Open a new terminal[ctrl]+[alt]+[T]
In this terminal connect to the vision system and run the first camera
	
	ssh odroid@camdar
	Enter vision system password (default: odroid)
	export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://PIG:11311
	cd ~/CameraDriver1/
	source devel/setup.bash
	rosrun cv_camera cv_camera_node

Open a new terminal [ctrl]+[alt]+[T]
This terminal will also connect to the vision system and will run the second camera
	
	ssh odroid@camdar
	Enter vision system password (default: odroid)
	export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://PIG:11311
	cd ~/usb_cam/
	source devel/setup.bash
	rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node

Open a new terminal [ctrl]+[alt]+[T]
This terminal will initialise the lidar system

	ssh odroid@camdar
	Enter vision system password(default: odroid)
	export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://PIG:11311
	cd ~/LidarDriver/
	source devel/setup.bash
	roslaunch rplidar_ros rplidar.launch

Now all topics should be open open a new terminal and run the command:

	rostopic list

This should show all topics, the ones to look for are:

	/scan
	/

Navigate back to the rviz window
	
	Click [add] -> [by topic] ->[rplidar]-> [/scan]
	Click [add]->[by topic]->[cv_camera]->[image]
	Click [add]->[by topic]->[usb_cam]->[image]
	

Change the [world]->[fixed frame] to

Laser

All vision systems should now be visible and working in the rviz GUI

To record the data locally (on the vision system hard drive) 
Open a new terminal [ctrl]+[alt]+[T]

	ssh odroid@camdar
 	Enter password (default: odroid)
	export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://PIG:11311
	rosbag record -a

Note: use [ctrl]+[C] in any terminal to close the topic when required.
