Temperature sensor code

Version 0.1

Setup analogue pins

read in voltages from pins one at a time and allocate them to temperature variables.

Temperature1, Temperature2, Temperature3

Set them through voltage divider calculation from set scale (approximately 0.1mv per Kelvin which translates to that per degree celsius).

once temperatures have been calculated send them outwards from the function.
