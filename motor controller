% Luke psuedocode for motor controller

pwm signal to the controller from the micro

set pwm signal to equal desired speed

set ADC converter 

if(pwm=5mv)
  send level of voltage to motor 
  
  else (pwm=10mv)
    up voltage sent to the motor to change speed 
  
  
  feedback form the motor to keep stable speed before stepping
  
  return speed allow tolerence 5% to stay in current voltage to motor
  
  have option of low pwm signal to initilaise reverse (not critical)
